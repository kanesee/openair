The OpenAIR project is a directory system for open-source AI technologies.

This project requires an installation of PHP with MySQL. Simply move the /htdocs/ folder to your apache home directory and import the most recent data file into your MySQL instance. 

In htdocs/utils.php change lines 5,6 and 7 to reference your MySQL database and all should work well.
