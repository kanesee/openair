The OpenAIR project is a directory system for open-source AI technologies.

This project requires an installation of PHP with MySQL. Simply move the /htdocs/ folder to your apache home directory and import the most recent data file into your MySQL instance. 
Alternatively, you can get the Docker container with everything you need installed and configured from https://hub.docker.com/r/kanesee/airesources/

In htdocs/_secret/mysql_pass.php change lines 5,6 and 7 to reference your MySQL database and all should work well.
You'll also need to edit auth/opauth.conf.php to add the OAuth login keys. Please contact InferLink for these keys or file.

Note, for oauth to work, the domain which this is served on must be http://airesources.org.
For development, you can modify your /etc/hosts file to temporary point airesources.org to your dev env machine.
