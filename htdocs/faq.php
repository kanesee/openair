		    <li>What is this site?
		     <p style="font-weight: normal;">AI Resources seeks to create one unified directory listing open source and open access resources that can be shared amongst the artificial intelligence community.</p>

		      <p style="font-weight: normal;">AI Resources relies on the contributions of the general public and people in the AI community for its content.

		    <li>How did this site get started?
		    <p style="font-weight: normal;">The concept for the site, and the design of the current site was developed by InferLink Corporation. The original designers included Steven Minton, Kane See, Brian Amanatullah, Greg Barish, Neha Kansal and Henry Erhardt.  The Allen Institute for AI played a crucial role in making the site real, by collecting and curating thousands of entries.  We thank Oren Etzioni for supporting the effort, and Isaac Cowhey who managed the project and contributed the bulk of the curation work.  AI Access Foundation is currently managing the site.</p>
